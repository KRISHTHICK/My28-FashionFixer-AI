# My28-FashionFixer-AI
GenAI

Thanks for the heads-up! Here's a brand-new, **unique AI fashion project idea** with extra features, **no virtual environment required**, and ready to run in VS Code and push to GitHub.

---

## 🧳 **Project Title: FashionFixer AI – Outfit Repair & Enhancement Advisor**

---

## 💡 **Problem It Solves:**

People often upload outfit photos with:

* Wrinkled clothes,
* Bad lighting,
* Poor fits,
* Color clashes.

**FashionFixer AI** analyzes the **visual quality of the outfit image**, **suggests fixes**, and gives **AI-enhanced outfit improvement advice**.

---

## ✨ **Unique Features:**

1. 🔍 **Wrinkle detector** – highlights wrinkled areas in clothes.
2. 🎨 **Color clash checker** – detects clashing color combos.
3. 📐 **Fit estimator** – flags oversized or too-tight fits (experimental).
4. 🔧 **Fix Suggestions** – iron, adjust size, recolor recommendations.
5. 💡 **AI-Powered Enhancement Tips** – like “Try a black belt for balance.”

    data = np.array(image).reshape((-1, 3))
    std_dev = np.std(data, axis=0)
    color_balance = np.mean(std_dev)
    return round(color_balance, 2)
